Here's what I got up to last week:

- Travelled to France by ferry on Wednesday night (Portsmouth to St Malo) and the sea was a bit rough but not too bad.
- Drove to Marion's parents Thursday morning and arrived in time for lunch
- Marion's brother and family arrived Friday night
- Had an excellent Christmas day and Christmas Eve (French celebrate on the 24th more than on the 25th).
- Kids super excited by Christmas and super happy to get their presents from Santa, and also to see their cousins.
- I got a whisky, some in-ear headphones for Zwifting, a jumper and some chocolates.
- Helped Arthur make a Lego train. Mainly it was finding and sorting bits of Lego but it enabled him to make it in two days so he was super happy.
- Helped Emma with her drawing and painting.
- Did part of a puzzle.
- Had a Zoom call with my parents in England wishing them happy Christmas
- Read lots finishing "Every Man for Himself and God Against All" and half of the next book ["Whale" by Cheon Myeong-Kwan](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29382499) (very good!)
- Watched a lot of the cyclocross via a VPN and Discovery+. MvdP, WvA and TP are back but so far it has been a MvdP masterclass.
- Played in the local park with the kids
- Went to Christmas eve mass in the village for the children
- Ate a lot of delicious food and drank a bit (hardly any really) of wine and beer. Feels really great to not feel groggy the next morning at Christmas time!
- The weather here is really mild so Marion's Dad turned off the heating and put on a nice Christmas fire both Christmas days.
